Positivity Check is in the early stages of improving the world through text!
The base program perfomrs an anlysis to determine the amount and strength of the positive/negative words used in the provided text. 
Building on this are scripts to analyze more specific text, such as tweets from twitter, comments on Reddit, and even scripts from TV shows and movies.
Most plain text can be processed with Positivity Check, but many sources will require some adjustments.
Positivity Check makes use of the AFINN-165 list for sentiment values.
